JingServer is an open source server for the Jing screenshot tool.

Powered by:
Python 2.x
Flask

Setup:
JingServer should come with everything you need, including the python and flask environment.

1) Make the uploads dir:
>> mkdir uploads
>> chmod 777 uploads

2) Run this to setup the virtual environment (might require Python virtualenv):
>> . env/bin/activate

3) Then you should be able to run:
>> python main.py
You should have a working jing server.

4) Edit your hosts file and redirect www.screencast.com to the IP of this jing server.


Todo:
1) setup caching and store the username & filename in the cache, keyed by the auth code & media set id
2) use the cached data for the filename instead of storing it as a class variable (would also to organize files by username & date)


I'm not going to write any code that lets you browse the uploaded files because other projects exist that specifically do that.
